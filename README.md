My first attempt at a website, made during the first weeks of my Web Development I class. I have since started to rebuild using the static site generator eleventy. The newer blog (which is in progress) can be found at sydneyandr.us and will hopefully look better in the coming weeks. The repo for the newer project is called blog-sydneyandrus.
