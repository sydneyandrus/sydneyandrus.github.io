  <h1>On Bread</h1>
  <p>In Simone Weil's essay <em>Forms of the Implicit Love of God</em>, she writes that "Every religious practice, every rite, all liturgy is a form of the recitation of the name of the Lord and in principle should have a real virtue, the virtue of saving whoever devotes himself to performing it with desire."</p>
  <p>In my life, the most important rite I find myself regularly performing is the act of making a loaf of sourdough bread. It is a form of communion between myself and the universe. I work in tandem with the colony of wild yeast I have cultivated for the last 3 years. My usual recipe looks something like the following:</p>
  <dev class="recipeIngredients">
    <dev class="levainIngredients">
    <p>Levain</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 T sourdough starter</li>
      <li>75 g water</li>
      <li>75 g bread flour</li>
    </ul>
    </dev>
    <dev class="doughIngredients">
      <p>Dough</p>
      <ul>
        <li>450 g bread flour</li>
        <li>50 g whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>100 g levain</li>
        <li>350 g water</li>
        <li>10 g salt + 25 g water</li>
      </ul>
      </dev>
  </dev>
  <ol>
    <li>6-12 hours before you start your dough, prep your levain by mixing your starter, flour, and water. Store in a relatively warm place, and try to use shortly after the levain has peaked. </li>
    <li>When your levain is ready, start by mixing flour, water, and starter together. This is a modified version of an autolyse stage called the fermentolyse stage. Leave your dough somewhere warm (ideally 78 F). </li>
    <li>After 30 minutes, mix your salt and remaining water to try to dissolve some of the salt. Then add this salt water mixture to your dough. Mix thoroughly.</li>
    <li>For the next 3-4 hours of bulk fermentation, perform a set of stretch and folds on your dough approximately every 30 minutes, keeping the dough in your bowl.</li>
    <li>After bulk fermentation, turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface for bench rest. Gently shape the dough into a round boule, then let it sit for 15-30 minutes until its shape has relaxed.</li>
    <li>After bench rest, reshape your boule and put loaf into a floured banneton.</li>
    <li>For your final proof, you can either keep your loaf in the refrigerator overnight (6-14 hours) or keep it at warmer temperatures for 3-4 hours. Keep an eye on the dough to make sure it doesn’t over proof.</li>
    <li>30 minutes before you are ready to bake, preheat your oven to 500 degrees with your cast iron dutch oven inside.</li>
    <li>Once the oven and dutch oven have fully preheated, remove your dough from the banneton and score the top before transfering into the dutch oven. It may be helpful to place your dough on a piece of parchment paper to aid the transfer to the dutch oven.</li>
    <li>Lower oven temperature down to 450 and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the dutch oven lid and continue to bake for 15-20 more minutes.</li>
    <li>Let the loaf cool completely before slicing. This can take up to 3 hours.</li>
  </ol>
