  <h1>On Poetry</h1>
  <p>Bob Dylan and Patti Smith both love the French poet Arthur Rimbaud. Arthur Rimbaud was born on October 20th, 1854, making him a Libra. He died on November 10th, 1891.</p>
  <p>The following is a poem by Arthur Rimbaud titled <em>The Seekers of Lice</em>, translated by Wallace Fowlie.</p>
  <p class="longQuote">When the child's forehead, full of red torments,<br>
    Implores the white swarm of indistinct dreams,<br>
    There come near his bed two tall charming sisters<br>
    With slim fingers that have silvery nails.<br>
    <br>
    They seat the child in front of a wide open<br>
    Window where the blue air bathes a mass of flowers<br>
    And in his heavy hair where the dew falls<br>
    Move their delicate, fearful and enticing fingers.<br>
    <br>
    He listens to the singing of their apprehensive breath.<br>
    Which smells of long rosy plant honey<br>
    And which at times a hiss interrupts, saliva<br>
    Caught on the lip or desire for kisses.<br>
    <br>
    He hears their black eyelashes beating in the perfumed<br>
    Silence; and their gentle electric fingers<br>
    Make in his half-drunken indolence the death of the little lice<br>
    Crackle under their royal nails.<br>
    <br>
    Then the wine of Sloth rises in him,<br>
    The sigh of an harmonica which could bring on delirium;<br>
    The child feels, according to the slowness of the caresses<br>
    Surging in him and dying continuously a desire to cry.<br>
