  <h1>On Poetry</h1>
  <p>Bob Dylan and Patti Smith both love the French poet Arthur Rimbaud. Arthur Rimbaud was born on October 20th, 1854, making him a libra. He died on November 10th, 1891.</p>
  <p>The following is a poem by Arthur Rimbaud titled <em>The Seekers of Lice</em>, translated by Wallace Fowlie.</p>
  <p>   When the child's forehead, full of red torments,
        Implores the white swarm of indistinct dreams,
        There come near his bed two tall charming sisters
        With slim fingers that have silvery nails.
    
        They seat the child in front of a wide open
        Window where the blue air bathes a mass of flowers
        And in his heavy hair where the dew falls
        Move their delicate, fearful and enticing fingers.
        
        He listens to the singing of their apprehensive breath.
        Which smells of long rosy plant honey
        And which at times a hiss interrupts, saliva
        Caught on the lip or desire for kisses.
        
        He hears their black eyelashes beating in the perfumed
        Silence; and their gentle electric fingers
        Make in his half-drunken indolence the death of the little lice
        Crackle under their royal nails.
        
        Then the wine of Sloth rises in him,
        The sigh of an harmonica which could bring on delirium;
        The child feels, according to the slowness of the caresses
        Surging in him and dying continuously a desire to cry.
